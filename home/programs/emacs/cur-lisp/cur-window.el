;;; cur-window.el --- Customization and helper functions for window management -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Custom functions and variables for managing windows.  In particular, setting `display-buffer-alist'
;; so that windows are just placed how I want.
;;
;; Much of this was shamelessly stolen from Protesilaos Stavrou, who greatly inspired much of my config.
;; Please see https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs#h:35b8a0a5-c447-4301-a404-bc274596238d for his window
;; management section of his Emacs config.
